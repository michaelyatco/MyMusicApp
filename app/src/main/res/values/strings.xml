    <!-- Explanation for the Payment Page -->
    <string name="payment_summary">This is where a user would make the payments necessary to enhance their experience with the music app - whether for purchasing new songs or subscribing to a music streaming service. I would try to incorporate a payment API like Stripe - https://stripe.com/docs/mobile/android. In my opinion, it would not be necessary to have any other Intents on this page besides returning to the home page.</string>
